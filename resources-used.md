# A list of resources I used while building this game!

1. The Udacity courses and instructors notes!
2. The Udacity forums!
3. Many, many Google searches about collision detection!
4. A pen and several pages of my notebook to draw out how collision detection actually worked!
5. GIMP to edit the images!
